                  My name is Jacob Plaisted, but I am formally known as Obiwan-Jacobi. I have
                  just joined the UNH coding bootcamp to persue my passion for programming &
                  technology. I am a lover of FOSS & open-source technologies, as well as, the communities
                  they create. I am a huge fan of <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> Operating system.  One of my favorite past times is playing
                  around on my Linux box and trying to figure out all the problems I created the previous
                  day when I was trying to fix other problems. :P  When I'm not fixing bugs and or creating them,
                  I love seeing how I can optimize my machine & tailor my UX/UI to fit my personal <i>aesthetic</i>.

                    &nbsp; When I'm not programming or playing around on my Computer, I love riding
                    white stallions along sugar sandy beaches while my hair flows majestically from a tender
                    sea breeze. Also, I love playing with my dog Linus and taking him on walks in the woods.
                    Linus & I are both very passionate about eating spicy ramens while watching
                    old anime shows,
